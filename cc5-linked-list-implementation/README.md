# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This challenge is to create a linked list class that can use various methods.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
This linked list class should be able to insert a new node, check all nodes for a value, and returns the linked list as a string.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
My approach was to create a linked list class with individual methods for each feature that was requested. 

This solution is a maximum of O(n) depending one what method is called. The longest method uses one while loop.
