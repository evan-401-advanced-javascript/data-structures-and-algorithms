# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This challenge is to create a class for stacks and one for queues. Within those classes they should both have methods to push, pop, and peek into the data structures.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create and manipulate stacks and queues with custom push pop and peek functionality.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Stacks: The stacks I created like they were a link list except instead of using a head I used a bottom. The big O of this class will be O(n) because the method with the biggest big O uses a loop.
* Queues: my approach for the queue was to create it similar to a linked list that enqueue's from left to right and dequeue's (removes nodes) from right to left. The big O for this is the same as the stack (O(n)) and at its slowest uses 1 while loop.

No white-boarding. This was done at home.
