# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This challenge is to use to stacks to simulate a queue. Using these stacks the class should be able to add and remove values in a FIFO fashion. 

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Add remove values from a queue using stacks.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
my approach was to represent the stacks as arrays and use the push and pop methods to add and remove values from the virtual queue. This solution is O(n) for time and 0(n) for space because I am using stacks.
