  // Structure and Testing
  // Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
  //
  // Write tests to prove the following functionality:
  //
  // Can successfully push onto a stack
  // Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
  // Can successfully pop off the stack
  // Can successfully empty a stack after multiple popsÎ©
  // Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
  // Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
  // Can successfully enqueue into a queue
  // Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
  // Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
  // Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
  // Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
  // Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
