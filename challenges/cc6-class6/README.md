# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
The purpose of this assignment is to be able to recursion with linked lists.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Use recursion to append and traverse a linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was to use a helper function to recursively add new nodes to my linked list.

My big O is O(n) because at my worst I use a while loop in one of my functions.
